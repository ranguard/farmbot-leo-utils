# Farmbot Utils and experiments

Using a [Farm Bot](https://farm.bot/) includes being able
to program `sequences` using [software](https://developer.farm.bot/)

This is a collection of things I've made up

### Lua Functions

- [Find home boot time](./sequences/find_home_boot/) - to be used at boot time
- [Find home periodically](./sequences/find_home_periodically/) - to be used by other sequences
